## About WISE R Club

---

WISE R Club is a study group in WISE set up by Xiaojun Sun and Xi Liu in Jun 20, 2014. It's a place where you can find people to learn R together. It's free and self-motivated.
Last year, we held eight sessions lectured by Xiaojun Sun, Kun Ren, and Guanghong Deng to introduce the basic skills of R, and some advanced packages of R.
